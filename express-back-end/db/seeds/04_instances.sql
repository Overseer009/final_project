Those agents broke free and created the Shadow Cabinet from inside. Hidden within the belly of the beast. Over the years this invisible monster would cause moments of mass destruction. At those times they were responsible for the death of thousands of innocent lives. They had little to no remorse. They’re view was control through fear. When the Black-Market and Criminal Syndicates got word that there was a new evil in town, they were ready to go to war. They’re attempts to over through the cabinet were quickly and quietly thwarted. Instead of a complete take over, the Shadow Cabinet decided to keep the syndicates to function as ever. Only now, they would be advised by Shadow Agents. The Shadow Cabinet devised a plan that would put them into the controlling seat of the world. But they needed the right tech to bring their plan to fruition. That’s when Cybernetics came to the militaries of the world’s attention in 2025. Testing began immediately. And the Shadow Cabinet observed the experiments and studied them while conducting their own projects. In 2032, the Cybernetics Augmentation program was shut down by the military. It was deemed too barbaric and inhuman. The chances of success were too low to apply it to mainstream technology. This suited the Cabinet just fine. For months they have been chipping away at the sanity of a Japanese Engineer whose daughter had just been blown apart in an explosive’s test (His daughter is a soldier in the military, she lost both of her legs and arms and half of her face.) The father demanded that they use the cybernetic technology that his company had been making for them to help her survive. They decide not to help him, explaining that he should just let go and be happy that she survived at all. She died a few days later. Under the influence of the Shadow Cabinet, the engineer steals the blueprints and the designs specs and publishes them for everyone to see. This could not have gone better, in the Cabinet’s eyes. They got the Syndicates to gather all the information that was leaked and assassinate any who got a hold of it. The Syndicates now had complete monopoly over Cybernetics. Several months later, many underworld clinics popped up boasting the latest in technology. Hundreds of the botched operations, but enough success to make people confident in trying. All of this was of course illegal. CyberMods and people found equipped with them were arrested. Rebel groups and Criminal gangs’ with CyberMods began sprouting up everywhere. It took three in some, 5 – 10 years in others for the Government to make CyberMods legal.", "February", 16, "https://ra.co/images/promoter/uk-illuminati-music.jpg?dateUpdated=1616588389563")
